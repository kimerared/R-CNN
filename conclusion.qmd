# Conclusion

In conclusion, our aim in this project was to thoroughly examine the Faster R-CNN method, alonside an exploration of alternatives like Mask R-CNN and YOLOv8. Our analysis clearly shows that both Mask R-CNN and YOLOv8 outperform Faster R-CNN in terms of spotting objects accurately, and inference time.

YOLOv8 stands out for its ability to detect objects in real-time situations. On the other hand, Mask R-CNN shines when it comes to accurately identifying objects in images and videos, especially when it requires understanding detailed object shapes and boundaries.

However, it's worth noting that Mask R-CNN's performance might rely heavily on having enough computing power because it needs more processing resources compared to YOLOv8. This highlights the importance of not only considering performance but also practical concerns and limitations when choosing a model for real-world applications.

In conclusion, our research sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses of different object detection methods. By providing practical insights, we believe that YOLOv8 algorithm offers a good trade-off between detection performance, and inference time. As technology progresses, it becomes increasingly important to refine these methodologies to meet the ever-changing demands of various real-world applications.
