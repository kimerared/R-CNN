# Abstract {.unnumbered}

The initial objective of this research paper is to evaluate the performance of the Faster R-CNN methodology on a dataset provided by Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, and Jian Sun in their paper titled "*Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks*," introduced at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in 2015 @ren2015fasterrcnn. We aim to replicate the results presented in this article, and gain a comprehensive understanding of Faster R-CNN, which will serve as the foundation for our future testing endeavors. Furthermore, we will assess the performance of Mask R-CNN, and YOLOv8 to offer a comparison of various object detection methodologies. A custom class label was applied to detect military tanks using a YOLOv8 model.
