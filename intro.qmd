# Introduction

Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, playing a crucial role in various applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and medical imaging. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the creation of sophisticated architectures such as Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and YOLO (You Only Look Once), all of which have substantially improved object detection performance. These architectures have revolutionized the field by achieving superior accuracy in detecting objects within images. However, despite significant advancements, a critical trade-off between accuracy and processing speed persists. It is essential to carefully consider this balance when selecting the most suitable model for practical applications.

The efficiency of object detection models is essential, particularly in real-time applications where rapid decision-making is vital. Currently, object detection primarily relies on region proposal methods and region CNNs. For instance, Selective Search, a widely used region proposal method, exhibits a speed of 2 seconds per image when implemented on the CPU, which is considered slow for many real-world applications. On the other hand, EdgeBoxes, another region proposal method, offers improved speed, clocking in at 0.2 seconds per image. However, a notable constraint remains--- even with advancements, the region proposal step still demands substantial computational resources when executed on the CPU rather than the GPU.

Moreover, comparing the performance of Faster R-CNN with region proposal methods poses challenges. Since R-CNNs leverage GPU acceleration while region proposal methods primarily rely on CPU computation. A fair comparison between the two becomes challenging. To address this issue, Region Proposal Networks (RPNs) were introduced in 2015 as part of the Faster R-CNN framework @ren2015fasterrcnn. A novel approach that integrates the region proposal step directly into the object detection algorithm itself. This architectural innovation aims to streamline the object detection process and improve overall efficiency by leveraging GPU resources effectively.
